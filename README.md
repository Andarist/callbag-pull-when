# callbag-pull-when

Callbag operator that pulls (samples) from source when provided listenable emits. It's [`sampleWhen`](https://github.com/Andarist/callbag-sample-when)'s version - this one works with pullable source, while the other one works with listenables.

It works similar to [Rx's sample](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/class/es6/Observable.js~Observable.html#instance-method-sample).
